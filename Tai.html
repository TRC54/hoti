                            <h2>Hello, My name is Tailin Roberson and i got here by starting an internship at this
                                little place called I.cstars back in 2024. During my internship
                                I met amazing people,got to get hands on training with code and even got to work wit
                                Pfizer on a project.
                                After my four months there I commenced and started to work fulltime at Pfizer as a PM.
                                As a PM I was able to
                                solve many of Pfizers previous technical issues using the skillset I learned from
                                I.Cstars. After about five
                                years of saving and investing. I decided to open up my own consulting business and spent
                                many sleepless
                                nights growing it into the consulting industry bastion that it is today. It took alot of
                                work,effort,sad
                                days and happy days and that journey is what created the guy in the picture you see on
                                this page. Thank you for reading! (You should totally click that square by the way) </h2>
